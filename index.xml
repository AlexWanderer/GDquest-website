&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-you-want-to-become-a-better-2d-game-artist&#34;&gt;Do you want to become a better 2d game artist?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You came to the right place! Using &lt;strong&gt;Krita, a free and open source painting application&lt;/strong&gt;, Game Art Quest will show you both &lt;strong&gt;essential concepts&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;concrete techniques&lt;/strong&gt; professionals use on a daily basis. &lt;a href=&#34;http://gdquest.com/tutorial/art/krita_tutorial_for_game_artists/&#34;&gt;The first course&lt;/a&gt; in the series is &lt;strong&gt;completely free&lt;/strong&gt; (6 hours of tutorials).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this series, &lt;strong&gt;I run you through the process of creating professional sprites for games&lt;/strong&gt;. I share my workflow and productivity tricks. Not only that! I will that Krita is the leading Free and Open Source digital painting program today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To become a more efficient artist, you have to sharpen your observation skills and explore fundamental techniques. These are the same regardless of the tools you are using, so the concepts you will learn apply to any painting application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/noscript&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://gdquest.com/krita-professional-game-art-tutorial&#34;&gt;second course&lt;/a&gt; also covers the unique constraints game artists face in their work. You have to make assets with a target resolution and camera in mind. You have to carefully draw your alpha masks. More importantly, as a game artist, &lt;strong&gt;your art has to support the gameplay: it shapes the game experience&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game Art Quest was funded &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/game-art-quest-make-professional-2d-art-with-krita&#34;&gt;on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; by 424 artists!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last update on April 9, 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am near Switzerland, in the French Alps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&amp;rsquo;m:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a mini game art series about cel shaded art with Krita&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparing a Kickstarter campaign for a game design course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gdquest.com/post/2017/marketing/marketing-indie-games-with-0-budget/&#34;&gt;Writing articles&lt;/a&gt; as a freelancer to pay the bills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding a blender add-on to make videos efficiently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gdquest.com/product/krita_brushes/&#34;&gt;GDquest Krita brushes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving this website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studying Japanese grammar and kanji&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trail running and chinese boxing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasionally writing hip-hop songs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m doing most of that, trying to make a living off my work so I can keep supporting open source game creators in a direct way: providing professional grade education for those tools, both paid and free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m open to opportunities, especially if you need somebody to create interesting tutorials. If you&amp;rsquo;re a fellow Youtuber, I love to do collab videos. It&amp;rsquo;s fun, motivating, and people &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVNOpMMbeNk&#34;&gt;seem to love that&lt;/a&gt;. So feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:nathan@gdquest.com&#34;&gt;drop me an email&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Marketing indie games with no budget – Notes</title>
      <link>http://gdquest.com/post/2017/marketing/marketing-indie-games-with-0-budget/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2017 20:33:30 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Emmy Jonhassen, aka IndieGameGirl, gave a talk named &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.indiegamegirl.com/no-budget-marketing/&#34;&gt;Marketing Indie Games on a $0 Budget&lt;/a&gt;. It offers a nice introduction to the topic, so I decided to share synthetic notes for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a detailed article on the topic for Game Analytics. There, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn a lot more about everything I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined below. Check it out: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gameanalytics.com/blog/marketing-indie-game-without-budget.html&#34;&gt;Marketing Your Indie Game On A Zero-Dollar Budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emmy outlines 5 key types of contents required to maximize your game’s reach before and after its release. All of the content has to be prepared thoughtfully in advance as part of a complete marketing plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-trailer&#34;&gt;1– Trailer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trailer is your n°1 marketing weapon. Both the users and the press will look at it to judge whether they’ll cover or play the game. A solid trailer needs the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should be less than 90 seconds long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its intro has to catch attention straight away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music and SFX are powerful tools to mark the minds. Make them great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is key to show a substantial amount of in-game-footage. Use reviews to your advantage: add quotes from professional reviews. Those give your game more credibility in the eyes of the viewer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End the video with a call to action: the potential buyer should know how to follow you, how to buy the game… make it big and clear!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/VA3saHRW3H8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-screenshots-and-gifs&#34;&gt;2- Screenshots and GIFs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each and every screenshot is its own little piece of art. If you follow artists on twitter, you know how popular artwork is, and how likely people are to like, comment and retweet them. When you design screens and GIFs, think about the people who look at them or want to use them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They should be in high resolution, and high quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to your visual composition. It should be balanced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure they are well lit, with both good brightness and contrast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The screens should look appealing, and really they should tell a story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2017/marketing-indie-games-with-0-budget/firewatch-sunrise.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Beautiful sunrise scene in the game Firewatch&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-press-release&#34;&gt;3- Press release&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your trailer and screenshots, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to compile them in a Press Release or PR. These documents are designed for journalists, who happen to be busy people. They get contacted all the time. People will copy and paste text from your PR, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re new and small. So you do want to write it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the essential characteristics of a good press release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the key information should be in the 1st paragraph. This includes the 5 Ws (What, Who, When, Where, Why?), and it should grab the reader&amp;rsquo;s attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should be well written, clear, and stick to the point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most important parts are the headline, the subhead, and the 1st paragraph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a quote from the creative director or someone inside the company to breathe life to your PR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have the company&amp;rsquo;s information and some ways to contact you at the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a link to your presskit, that contains the trailer and best screenshots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use in-text hyperlinks so people can jump to another page with a single click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-landing-page&#34;&gt;4- Landing page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landing page is a powerful marketing asset. It is a vitrine for your game, that&amp;rsquo;ll convert visitors to buyers. Emmy mentions the best practices for it to work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No navigation. You don&amp;rsquo;t want the top links to take any clicks away from the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature an attention-grabbing headline at the top. Most people will only read that, just like with articles. Give them a reason to check out the trailer, the screenshots, and generally to stay on the page. Use the headline to talk to your target audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include social sharing links on the side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the trailer video prominent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a strong call to action button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a selection of your best screenshots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mention good reviews and testimonials from influent sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the bottom, leave links to your presskit and ways to contact you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2017/marketing-indie-games-with-0-budget/hollow-knight-teaser.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hollow knight game screenshot&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        Hollow knight has a great landing page
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-devblog&#34;&gt;5- Devblog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a devblog can bring you a lot of extra traffic, and help you build a fanbase, although it takes some work. Here are Emmy&amp;rsquo;s tips for it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post at least once a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always use images in your articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link to the devblog in your website&amp;rsquo;s navigation bar and from the homepage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide an RSS feed and/or email subscriptions. If people take that step to subscribe, they&amp;rsquo;ll get notified and they&amp;rsquo;re a lot more likely to check out your next stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include links to your accounts on social networks and social sharing icons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call to action. Remind people where they can get your game and some key info they&amp;rsquo;d like to know about at end of every post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Construct 2 tutorials</title>

      <guid>http://gdquest.com/old/construct-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a another life, I wrote a handful of tutorials for Construct 2. They&amp;rsquo;re not on this website anymore, but you can still find them on the engine&amp;rsquo;s official website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I make videos tutorials about game creation with free, open source game creation tools: &lt;a href=&#34;http://gdquest.com&#34;&gt;learn more about GDquest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- This goes below the landing page --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been in the games industry for a few years now. I made my own indie game company, worked on mobile and browser-based titles. I had a blast, but I felt like we missed quality game art tutorials.That’s why I created GDquest. GDquest is a growing library of 150+ &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtube.com/c/gdquest&#34;&gt;free game creation tutorials&lt;/a&gt; about game design, game art, and programming with open source technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intro to monster design is the first free training released on GDquest. In about 40 minutes, it will &lt;strong&gt;run you through the thought process a game artist might follow to design monsters&lt;/strong&gt;. It both covers the thought process behind the design of a monster and an example of monster drawing with pen, paper and Krita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version 12 (&lt;em&gt;March 2017&lt;/em&gt;) contains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;73 unique brush presets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 pdf documents&lt;/strong&gt; to help you get started with the brushes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly updates&lt;/strong&gt;. More brushes and videos are already on your way!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium tier adds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than 30 minutes of exclusive video tutorials&lt;/strong&gt; to get the most out of the brushes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;natural media brushkit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priority support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take my time to design the presets and ensure that they are worth adding to the pack. I also use them in my daily work to ensure that they are tested thoroughly in all kinds of configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

My favorites in the pack are the mix and smudge brushes. Honestly, if you like the Lite set, it&amp;rsquo;s worth it, Krita is going somewhere.&amp;raquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version 10 is a maintenance update. It comes with 4 new presets, but also 11 existing brushes got better! Performance improvements, improved feel&amp;hellip; a good way to prepare major changes coming over the next few updates. As on every other month, I released &lt;a href=&#34;https://gumroad.com/l/krita-brushes-gdquest-lite&#34;&gt;7 new free Krita brushes&lt;/a&gt; in the.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 new presets including a blur tool, splatter brushes, and a rock texture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 natural media presets, and especially a powerful cloud painting tool (premium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new tutorial on cloud painting (premium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;version-8-nov-2016&#34;&gt;Version 8 - Nov 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 textured rock brushes: these presets will allow you to add 2 types of sharp grain to your rocks, for a more believable look.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smear cloud: whether you want to slightly blur or completely diffuse your edges, this is a very efficient preset to do so. It blurs your painting fast and provides very good control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoke dusty: this brush can be used for both clouds and smoke. Unlike the existing cloud builder brushes, it offers some high frequency details for a richer look.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 water brushes: the first water brushes are in! They&amp;rsquo;re useful to paint waves, for a lake, a sea or an ocean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tree leaves builder: a nice brush to quickly add detailed leaves to a piece of concept art.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;version-7-oct-2016&#34;&gt;Version 7 (Oct 2016)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Rock presets: draw small, round and stylized rocks with Rock builder stylized, and detail them with the Rock_detail brush&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 special presets for shading: the special_shadow brush allows you to stamp simple round shadows, to place under characters and small assets. The other 2 brushes are directional shading brushes, with a sharp and a soft side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 pencil-looking brushes: one for sketching, and one for shading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated paint_old preset: I remade the preset from scratch. It is at least twice as fast, and strokes are more consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;version-6-sep-2016&#34;&gt;Version 6 (Sep 2016)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 pixel art deform tools: pixel art-friendly Grow, Shrink, Move and Swirl tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 cloud builder brushes: the first builders are here! These presets will help you paint accurate sprite silhouettes in no time. These will work for both stylized and realistic clouds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 smoke brushes: for when you need to achieve a textured smoky effect. Also useful to add definition to materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text-based install guide (pdf)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An intro to brush families (pdf)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The past 2 months have been hectic. I’ll pass on the details, but since a few days, I’m renting an office. After so much time struggling to work from home, you can’t imagine how great it feels! I not only have access to the room 24/7, it’s also part of a local business incubator. The structure offer a lot of support, free training on accounting, management, legal stuff… All of which is quite complex in France. The building is great, and there are other entrepreneurs to share your thoughts and struggles with. Actually, the team in the office right in front of mine is into 3-D printing, and they are super nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it’s news time. In this month’s update, we talk about the weekly releases on the premium game art tutorial, the Godot tutorial series that’s happening right now on the channel, and FOSDEM and GodotCon, 2 events taking place from February 4 to 7. I’m going to give the Godot team a hand and prepare some upcoming project, so we can meet there! To get more details about all of that, I invite you to watch the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you in February for the next update!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Back from japan, back to work</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m back from Japan! Physically at least: my heart is still back there. I’ve been traveling around the country for a bit less than a month, and the experience was incredible. It was a great occasion to practice Japanese and get a better sense for the culture. I’ve read and been told a lot of things before going, and reality felt a lot subtler than what you would expect at first. Some facts were somewhat true, others plain wrong. The collectivism there felt wonderful. The french culture is a lot more individualistic, which is part of what makes me feel like a foreigner here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be a sheer contrast between Japanese people&amp;rsquo;s behavior during daytime, and at night. When they are tipsy, or even completely drunk, you&amp;rsquo;re up for all sorts of surprises! And it&amp;rsquo;s fine for them to drink way too much and end up sleeping on the sidewalk in larger cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Japan is beautiful. And a picture is probably worth a thousand words in that regards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/144749747@N03/30581295540/in/album-72157674849188902/&#34; title=&#34;Sunset on Naoshima&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5783/30581295540_8642c0298a_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; alt=&#34;Sunset on Naoshima&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been out hiking, meeting people, making friends&amp;hellip; enjoying the soothing nature. If you ever travel there, I would warmly recommend walking the Kumano Kodo, a pilgrimage route. At least if you’re into trekking. Oh, and when you&amp;rsquo;re on your way down to Tanabe City, be sure stop by Osaka and eat some freshly cooked okonomiyaki with cheese topping. It tastes great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;looking-for-a-proper-workplace&#34;&gt;Looking for a proper workplace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, let’s get back to the channel. Last week, I wrote a business plan and applied to a local business incubator. It’s a place where you can get an office, along with other young companies. Experienced people follow your work and are here to guide you. If they accept GDquest, this will help the project greatly in the coming year. It is getting hard for me to work at home. I need to get out of here. That’s why I took a few extra days to refine the document: I want - no, I need it to work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;upcoming-updates&#34;&gt;Upcoming updates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what&amp;rsquo;s coming next on GDquest. As far as free content is concerned, until the end of December, you’ll be getting some more Krita tutorials from the Game Art Quest series. In the meantime, I’ll be hard at work on a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next training product, which is very important, the game art workshop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Krita brushes and the Krita training series will get a little bit of love through monthly updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I must improve some aspects of the website. In particular, a library page is coming in the next few weeks. It will compile all of the tutorials from the channel in an appealing and organized way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there will still be weekly free videos on the channel. I have to produce some new ones, in parallel to the training products. I&amp;rsquo;ve already prepared the next free series, which will be an introduction to the Godot game engine!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll find some time to do a few collabs with other artists. We got in touch with Daniel, aka &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGgpthBWDbFX2GSljMw-MdQ&#34;&gt;Borodante&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;pronounced Borrrrr-rodante&lt;/em&gt;), and some other tutorial makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;come-chat-with-the-community-on-discord&#34;&gt;Come chat with the community on Discord!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;card-box clearfix&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;card-content&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve opened a server on Discord for everyone in the community to join and talk about game creation with open source programs.
      Whether you just want to drop by and say hi, showcase your artwork or share your knowledge about Krita and Godot, you’re
      more than welcome!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&#34;text--center&#34;&gt;
      &lt;a href=&#34;https://discord.gg/KVaCsSP&#34; class=&#34;button button--pill button--success button--full lead&#34;&gt;Join the Discord server&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sara-tepes&#34;&gt;Sara Tepes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara Tepes, a hard-working 17 years old illustrator, talked about GDquest in her last video. I’ve been following her for months now, and her message was heartwarming! So now it’s my turn: if you want to see appealing live Krita demonstrations, check out Sara’s channel on YouTube. She uploads commented time-lapses every week and she already produces very appealing art despite her young age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWgMcluGLnaVpCWmscaFs_Q&#34;&gt;Sara Tepes on Youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;that-said&#34;&gt;That said&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to get back to work! I&amp;rsquo;ll upload the Krita brushes update in the coming week (Nov 14-20), as well as a video overview of the new features in Krita 3.1. Yes, a new major release is right around the corner, and among other things, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be the first stable Mac version!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time!
Nathan&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game Art Quest vol1 done! Off to Japan</title>
      <link>http://gdquest.com/post/2016/japan-news/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the first volume of Game Art Quest is done. 6.2 hours of free Krita tutorials (some are still upcoming on the channel). 7 hours if you include the first bonus series of the year: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KExm_EYLVhD6yf4Afax24fV&#34;&gt;Introduction to monster design for 2-D games&lt;/a&gt;. Looking back at the Kickstarter description, this is already more than the promised as far as the total length is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gum.co/krita-tutorial-for-game-artists&#34;&gt;Early access&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i class=&#34;my-fa fa-shopping-cart

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gdquest.com/tutorial/art/krita_tutorial_for_game_artists/&#34;&gt;Available tutorials&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra premium brushes and their companion tutorials are also getting pretty big. With this month&amp;rsquo;s update, it now includes 34 presets and more than 30 minutes of video tutorials. And more coming monthly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Aq3LvQYyld4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But we are not done yet! I&amp;rsquo;m pre-producing the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; volume of Game Art Quest, which will help you to put all you&amp;rsquo;ve learned in practice. It is a workshop series in which you&amp;rsquo;ll create your own game mockups. On top of that, I&amp;rsquo;m planning to update the first volume from time to time with assignments and useful documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for now, it&amp;rsquo;s time to take some rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;off-to-japan&#34;&gt;Off to Japan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m taking a flight to Japan on October 3, and coming back at the end of the month. It&amp;rsquo;s a trip I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking forward to for a long time. And now more than ever, after 2 years studying Japanese, with already a number of people to meet there. I&amp;rsquo;ll have both a camera and a tablet to share the most interesting adventures with you on social networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamedev-wise, I&amp;rsquo;ll be paying the author of Pico8 and Voxatron a visit at his picotachi café in Tokyo, along with a French indie developer who lives in Japan, Erhune, the co-author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gangsofspace.com/&#34;&gt;Gangs of Space&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m also meeting a tech developer from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.q-games.com/&#34;&gt;Q-games&lt;/a&gt; in Kyoto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I&amp;rsquo;ll travel to the sacred Shinto island of Miyajima, walk the Kumano Kodo, the emperors&amp;rsquo; pilgrimage route, meet Japanese monkeys in Kyoto, and a lot more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am not gone yet, and there&amp;rsquo;s still some more content coming your way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-krita-brushes&#34;&gt;More Krita brushes!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest version of the Krita brushes for game artists is out. The full set now contains 34 presets, 5 video tutorials and 2 PDF guides. It includes pixel art drawing tools, but more importantly the first few presets of the elements family, which are dedicated to help you paint elements of nature efficiently and flexibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gum.co/krita-brushes-for-game-artists&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/page/krita-brushes/Krita brushes banner 2016-07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Krita brushes for game artists&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2 cloud builder brushes in this release make it effortless to paint game-ready clouds sprites. Using the cloud blender from last month, you can also soften any sharp edge with great control. Even though I&amp;rsquo;m away next month, you&amp;rsquo;ll still get your dose of new tools!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lite set also got some love. It is now twice as big, for a total of 16 presets. It is completely free, and gets an update every 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gum.co/krita-brushes-for-game-artists&#34;&gt;Krita brushes premium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i class=&#34;my-fa fa-shopping-cart

&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gumroad.com/l/krita-brushes-gdquest-lite&#34;&gt;Lite version&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;plans-for-the-week&#34;&gt;Plans for the week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not enough time to start producing and releasing the new training this week. I&amp;rsquo;d rather take the time to pre-produce it the right way, and be ready to create the first tutorials when I&amp;rsquo;m back from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I have some overdue editing jobs for the KDE community. I interviewed experienced open source developers back in June, and they had some deep insights to share with people interested in free technologies. That&amp;rsquo;s something I have to tackle this week. The videos will come out as a bonus during October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transitional week is also a good occasion to work on the website. A new version recently rolled out with some improvements, especially simplified visuals. There&amp;rsquo;s less useless content, so that the current 200 to 300 daily visitors get a better experience with navigation. Especially newcomers. Here are the goals for the week:
- Update the main Krita training page
- Improve the course page&amp;rsquo;s visuals for clearer navigation
- Add accessibility-related code
- And maybe add an about page again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I&amp;rsquo;ve got to prepare posts for social networks in advance so you still get your weekly tutorials and some useful tips next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s it for now. If you have to remember one thing from this post: I&amp;rsquo;m away in October. So don&amp;rsquo;t expect superfast replies to emails and questions. Oh, and by the way, the channel got past 1 million views. Next stop: the 10 million mark!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has been a while since the last behind the scenes news post. There&amp;rsquo;s been good progress with the tutorials and the brushes. I&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work lately, especially changing my workflow to increase production speed, maintaining the same quality. On the other hand, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to update the website and social networks as often as I would&amp;rsquo;ve liked. Aside from that&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;krita-3-0-1-is-out&#34;&gt;Krita 3.0.1 is out!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krita 3.0 .1 came out this week. Although it was just a minor bug-fixing release, it does add a number of new features to the program. These include soft proofing, mirror tool options, horizontal and vertical flip buttons in free transform mode, threshold and wavelet decompose, the ability to use the gradient map as a filter layer, and more! You can find the full release notes &lt;a href=&#34;https://krita.org/en/item/krita-3-0-1-update-brings-numerous-fixes/&#34;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; the official website, and below is a video overview of most of these:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/9S_x6koOVBo&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also an &lt;a href=&#34;https://krita.org/en/item/experimental-osx-build-available/&#34;&gt;experimental Mac build&lt;/a&gt; with openGL support! It needs extensive testing, so if you&amp;rsquo;re a Mac user, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get your hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-swiss-game-academy&#34;&gt;The Swiss Game Academy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August, I was invited to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gameacademy.ch/&#34;&gt;Swiss Game Academy&lt;/a&gt;, a weeklong event where Swiss game developers team up to offer a very affordable training to students interested in game creation. At the same time, it is a game jam open to enthusiasts of any age, starting at 10! Although I&amp;rsquo;m French, I live next to the Swiss border, and I got in touch with developers last year. There are few game studios in the country, yet the indie scene is really lively. Many jams take place around the Geneva lake, and dozens of people meet monthly in Lausanne to share insights about their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- TODO: Screenshot --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Game Academy, we were a team of 15 people to take care of dozens of students, and we took turns to train them in the morning. I was there to show how to create game sprites with Krita, and to hopefully convince hobbyists that they didn&amp;rsquo;t need Photoshop! Few of them had ever heard of the program, and most were quite impressed with its features, including other members of the staff. The wraparound mode, symmetry drawing tools, the pop-up palette, and more importantly PSD support seduced many. Over the course of 3 hours, we covered all of the fundamentals, and went through the whole asset creation workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the last event I accepted to be part of, and that until the whole Kickstarter project is done. It was great though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ludum-dare-36-small-learning-godot-preparing-the-next-series-small&#34;&gt;Ludum Dare 36 &lt;small&gt;learning Godot, preparing the next series&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back from Switzerland, there was the 36&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; edition of the Ludum Dare. I took this opportunity to prepare the next training series for Game Art Quest: the one where we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on creating games sprites. I made a very small game that showcases what you can do with static game assets. The project is set in the world of David Revoy&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.peppercarrot.com/&#34;&gt;Pepper and Carrot&lt;/a&gt;, with our favorite ginger cat as the main character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a small isometric 2-D game where a cat throws ridiculous spells at scarecrows and ghosts. Alright, I&amp;rsquo;ll figure out a nicer introduction for the course release! At that occasion, I learned how to work with Godot 2.1, which deeply impressed me. It came a long way since version 1.0. It feels a lot more polished, and it&amp;rsquo;s well documented. Within 3 days, I managed to get a small working prototype. There&amp;rsquo;s work left to polish it a bit, but it&amp;rsquo;ll give us a nice base project for the game art workshops, where I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to replace my sprites and put your own art into the game!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2016/09/ludum-dare-36-godot-prototype.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Carrot&#39;s Magic: my Ludum Dare 36 prototype&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;krita-tutorials-where-are-we-at&#34;&gt;Krita tutorials: where are we at?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve passed the halfway mark! You now have more than 6 hours of tutorials available &lt;a href=&#34;https://gum.co/krita-tutorial-for-game-artists&#34;&gt;on Gumroad&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;if you backed the initial Kickstarter, you got a coupon via email&lt;/em&gt;). There&amp;rsquo;s one chapter left in the first volume, dedicated to Krita&amp;rsquo;s animation features. I know that a lot of you are waiting eagerly for this series, and it&amp;rsquo;s around the corner!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- TODO: Screenshot --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game Art Quest doesn&amp;rsquo;t end there. After that, I will focus on the game art workshops, in which we will explore 2 different art styles: painterly, and cel shaded. At the same time, we will learn more about the constraints we face with camera angles as 2-D game artists. Exploring side-scrolling and isometric games will be a great occasion to talk about how we can achieve good atmospheric perspective and decent character proportions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will do my best to provide you as much information as possible on the topics. Contrary to the first volume though, it has to be a real workshop. You&amp;rsquo;ll get to create your own sprites along with the videos, and if you do all of the assignments, you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with your own game mockup at the end. This workshop series will take me a few more months to create, especially as I&amp;rsquo;m flying off to Japan in October (holidays!). And you can expect this second series to be about 5 hours long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to know when it&amp;rsquo;ll be available? You just have to enter your email address in the field below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;off-to-japan&#34;&gt;Off to Japan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I&amp;rsquo;m flying off to Japan in October. After 2 years studying the language, it is time to go and discover the country. I&amp;rsquo;ll be spending some time in large cities, as well as in nature. I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to walking on the Kumano Kodo, a network of mountain trails where emperors used to do pilgrimages. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to share nice pictures and my experiences in this intriguing county. I will also be meeting some game developers and hopefully the Krita artist &lt;a href=&#34;https://krita.org/en/item/interview-with-omiya-tou/&#34;&gt;Omiya Tou&lt;/a&gt; in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- TODO: Screenshot --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have travelled very little so far, and it&amp;rsquo;ll be my first time on a long-haul flight. It&amp;rsquo;s also a personal treat after a few years working in the gaming industry, taking little time off, and creating GDquest 18 months ago. It&amp;rsquo;ll be a great occasion to fully relax, and come back to full productivity in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get back to work. Well, actually to share dinner with a few friends, at the time of writing. But you know what I mean!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>June update: the Randa meetings</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re getting to the end of June. It&amp;rsquo;s time to sum up all that&amp;rsquo;s been happening this month. The short version: I kept improving the website, went to the biggest yearly KDE development sprint in Randa, Switzerland, and added about 1h of tutorials dedicated to Krita 3&amp;rsquo;s new features in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gdquest.com/tutorial/art/krita_tutorial_for_game_artists/&#34;&gt;Krita training&lt;/a&gt;. You can find more details about what happened in Randa, and what the plans are for July, below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;randa&#34;&gt;Randa&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From June 13 to 19, I was in Randa, KDE&amp;rsquo;s biggest yearly sprint. KDE is a large community of free software developers and users. Krita is part of it, and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly the most popular multiplatform KDE program today. Sadly, no one else from the team could make it to the sprint this year. They ran a hectic Kickstarter in May, and boud, Krita&amp;rsquo;s maintainer, had too much work to do the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randa was an amazing experience for me. There, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to produce Krita tutorials. I mostly jumped around projects, learned about the whole KDE ecosystem, and helped with communication and UX design. It&amp;rsquo;s incredible to get in touch with so many cultures at once. People came from all around the world. There was Joseph, from Kenya, who came to port KDEnlive on Windows. Lays and Ayrton, from Brazil, working on an open 3d printing program. Developers from India, Germany, Denmark&amp;hellip; you name it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2016/06/Randa-meetings-work-discussions.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;KDE Randa meetings: developers discussions&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those people are so different&amp;hellip; and yet they all work together to hopefully make the computer world a slightly better place. There was such a strong ambience there that we all worked very hard. I was up around 7:00 every morning, and went off to bed at 23:00. I spent the vast majority of the day working. And it was pretty much the same for everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The village we stayed at itself was peaceful and lovely. A perfect, undistracted place to both focus and relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2016/06/Randa-view-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Randa view of the mountains&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The view was gorgeous from my office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;time-to-make-some-money-again&#34;&gt;Time to make some money again&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I told you in a previous update, Game Art Quest became bigger than what it was supposed to be. With the Kickstarter, we raised enough money for six months of full-time work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These six months are getting to an end, so I have to make a bit of money again. I&amp;rsquo;m getting new offers on a weekly basis, but until now, I almost declined them all. However, I accepted one job writing Krita tutorials for a magazine this month. It is a great opportunity as they asked me to work on animation, which I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered yet in the training, thus it&amp;rsquo;s not distracting me from daily work too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking to start working on and selling the next 2 volumes of the training in early access at the end of July. If I sell enough, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to keep working full-time on it. Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;ll dedicate one day per week to client work, which shouldn&amp;rsquo;t slow down the production of the training noticeably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;one-video-a-week&#34;&gt;One video a week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s summer time in here. The hot weather is back, and people are taking time off. I&amp;rsquo;m not! I&amp;rsquo;ll be here all summer long, working at the same pace. However, now that the tutorial series covering Krita 3&amp;rsquo;s new features is out, we&amp;rsquo;re going to move back to a rhythm of 1 tutorial per week on the channel. This will give me more time to improve the GDquest Blender add-on, and to prepare the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gdquest.com/post/2016/community/vote-for-upcoming-tutorials-january-2016/&#34;&gt;future series&lt;/a&gt; coming to the channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-week&#34;&gt;This week&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap up June, I have to release a brush pack update. This new version will contain 4 new brushes, and I painted a new thumbnail for the blender brush, as the current one looks horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2016/06/Flat-blender-brush.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;New flat blender brush icon&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;rsquo;m working on the fourth chapter in the Krita training, to release it as soon as possible. It will introduce you to the game assets creation workflow. As soon as it is out, I will move on to the second volume of the training, which you will be able to access on Gumroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving into July, I have to get working again on the blender of VSE add-on. It is one of the main ways I can improve my productivity creating the video tutorials now. My goal is to add one new feature every single week, even if it&amp;rsquo;s small. This week for instance, I&amp;rsquo;m working on an import feature that loads all of the project&amp;rsquo;s video and audio files to the VSE in one click. As I get to create up to six videos in a single week, this feature will be a real time saver. And with that, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to release the first public version of the add-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2016/06/blender-vse-add-on-code.png&#34; alt=&#34;Blender GDquest VSE add-on import code&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The import code is already there - it just needs to be refined&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get back to work! Thank you all for reading. Thank you for constant support and your kind words. I read all of your comments on Youtube, on social networks, and the messages you send me via email. It&amp;rsquo;s really heartwarming to see some of you following everything that&amp;rsquo;s happening on a weekly basis. Big thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>May update: Krita brushes and ConciseCSS</title>
      <link>http://gdquest.com/post/2016/new-website-and-krita-brushes-update/</link>

      <guid>http://gdquest.com/post/2016/new-website-and-krita-brushes-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;May has been a busy month. I did my best to keep up with everyone on social networks, to give a hand to the Krita developers, with their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjIiI8uiVNM&#34;&gt;Kickstarter campaign&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; But I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to write longer news posts like this one. Time to share the news for this month! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I&amp;rsquo;m still catching up with work, since I got that shoulder injury. Thankfully, I got faster in some areas, especially answering people online, thus I&amp;rsquo;m making good progress. On to the news!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div grid&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;card-box&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2016/05/krita-logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Featured picture&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h3 class=&#34;card-title&#34;&gt;Krita 3 launch Youtube livestream&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;content&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krita 3 is out tomorrow! I will be live on YouTube to answer all of your questions about the program, GDquest, and game art in general. I will also create 2-D game assets to fill in the blanks. To join the event, click on the link below and show up tomorrow, at 6 PM &lt;abbr title=&#34;Central Europe Standard Time (UTC/GMT +2)&#34;&gt;CEST&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    
    &lt;div class=&#34;card-footer -center&#34;&gt;
      &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlcHDRc-gN8&#34;&gt;Youtube Livestream&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;krita-brushes-may-update&#34;&gt;Krita brushes May update&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a set of &lt;a href=&#34;https://gum.co/krita-brushes-for-game-artists&#34;&gt;Krita brushes for game artists&lt;/a&gt;, available on Gumroad. It was initially meant to just be a simple brush pack, I started adding video tutorials on top of it last week to explain what each preset was designed for. This month&amp;rsquo;s update adds 2 new blending brushes: both a round and a flat one. These work a bit like the regular mixing brushes, but they only blend existing colors on the selected layer. They are way softer than existing presets to help you shade extremely smooth surfaces like silk, skin, clouds, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2016/05/krita-brushes-update-may-2016.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Picture: The brushes on the pop-up palette&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will now find 2 tutorials along with the brushes. The first one is dedicated to the mix brushes, and it will show you how to play with the opacity setting to get the most out of them. The 2nd one explains how to use the smear brushes in practice. They may seem strange at first, but trust me, they are actually quite useful! On top of that, I updated the existing brushes to make them less resource intensive. The Paint_Painterly preset comes with a new custom brush tip, and it should be at least 3 or 4 times faster now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;gdquest-s-upgrade&#34;&gt;Gdquest&amp;rsquo;s upgrade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new version of the website is available! I ported it to a new SASS framework, &lt;a href=&#34;http://concisecss.com/&#34;&gt;ConciseCSS&lt;/a&gt;. Some things have changed visually, hopefully for the better. But more importantly, under the hood, everything is different. With the same functionality, the website&amp;rsquo;s Go templates are about 20% shorter. The CSS is smaller, and now I have full control over everything. Not only was the port fast to do, but now I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to improve GDquest faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, I was using &lt;a href=&#34;http://getbootstrap.com/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most popular frameworks out there, made by Twitter. It is very good, but it&amp;rsquo;s also huge. It has everything you&amp;rsquo;d ever need, as well as everything you would never need. Because of that, customizing the style of your website can take a lot of time. That&amp;rsquo;s why I switched to Concise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the next version, I will also release the website&amp;rsquo;s code open source. That way, those of you who want a powerful system to create a tutorial/blog oriented website will have an option based on Hugo, a blazing fast, open source static website engine. Right now, the website handles posts, course pages, course summaries, and has some simple modules if you&amp;rsquo;d like to create a blog page for instance. The next version will add templates to render a to do list, to render FAQs, to create a landing page, but also to create a tutorial/articles library!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-up&#34;&gt;Next up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June is going to be a busy month! From June 13 to 19, I&amp;rsquo;ll be at the Randa meetings in Switzerland to work on Krita education, and to meet dozens of passionate KDE developers. The Randa meetings are a yearly open source development sprint. Developers gather from all around the world and share experience with one another to push their respective projects forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Krita 3 is coming out, I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on video tutorials dedicated to the new version. I plan to create about a dozen. Then, I&amp;rsquo;ll move on to chapter 3 of the Krita tutorial for game artists, which will run you through the game assets creation workflow. This chapter is going to be an entire little training in itself, and a great occasion to put everything you&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far in the training in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wraps up this month&amp;rsquo;s update. Thank you kindly for your time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;See you soon,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nathan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/krita/krita-2016-lets-make-text-and-vector-art-awesome&#34;&gt;Krita 2016 Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. It ends in 8 days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
