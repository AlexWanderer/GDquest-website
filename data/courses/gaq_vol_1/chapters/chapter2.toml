description = "This second chapter provides an introduction to the game art workflow with Krita. It explains the iterative nature of game art, as well as the broad steps involved in creating original game assets, from design to the finished product. I will also provide you with an example to show you which tools I use the most, and how I've adapted my workflow to Krita. Every major step of the process is broken down into 2 videos: the first one is focused on the design of the game asset, and the second one focuses on Krita drawing techniques, on applying what we learned in chapter 1."

title = "Overview of the game asset painting workflow"
description = " the broad steps to create any piece of art are pretty much always the same. We start by exploring possible designs, by sketching multiple thumbnails. Then, we pick one of our thumbnails and we move on to blocking foundations for our final piece. The next step is called refining, and mostly consists of turning our blocking into a good-looking piece of artwork. The last step is polishing. It's the most time-consuming one. At that point, we know that our artwork is already working well, so we can focus on improving its shading and adding all sorts of tiny details."

title = "Polishing sprites"
description = " polishing is one of the hardest steps to teach, as it is mostly a game of patience and observation. It is the process of taking an artwork that already looks good, and making it look finished. It is the longest step in the art creation process, that can take more than half of your time working on something."
