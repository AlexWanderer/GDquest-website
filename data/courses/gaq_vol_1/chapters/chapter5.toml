description = "The traditional animation toolset expands on the already solid foundations provided by Krita 2.9. In this chapter, we are going to explore that new system, see how we can leverage it for our games, and talk a little bit about animation. However, this is not a comprehensive introduction to animation by any means. This is a project driven chapter. We will create a little animation using a character sheet is a reference. This will allow us to explore Krita's animation toolset as we go."
