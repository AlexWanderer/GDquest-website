      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re getting to the end of June. It&amp;rsquo;s time to sum up all that&amp;rsquo;s been happening this month. The short version: I kept improving the website, went to the biggest yearly KDE development sprint in Randa, Switzerland, and added about 1h of tutorials dedicated to Krita 3&amp;rsquo;s new features in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gdquest.com/game-art-quest/volume-1/krita-tutorial-for-game-artists/&#34;&gt;Krita training&lt;/a&gt;. You can find more details about what happened in Randa, and what the plans are for July, below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;randa&#34;&gt;Randa&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From June 13 to 19, I was in Randa, KDE&amp;rsquo;s biggest yearly sprint. KDE is a large community of free software developers and users. Krita is part of it, and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly the most popular multiplatform KDE program today. Sadly, no one else from the team could make it to the sprint this year. They ran a hectic Kickstarter in May, and boud, Krita&amp;rsquo;s maintainer, had too much work to do the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randa was an amazing experience for me. There, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to produce Krita tutorials. I mostly jumped around projects, learned about the whole KDE ecosystem, and helped with communication and UX design. It&amp;rsquo;s incredible to get in touch with so many cultures at once. People came from all around the world. There was Joseph, from Kenya, who came to port KDEnlive on Windows. Lays and Ayrton, from Brazil, working on an open 3d printing program. Developers from India, Germany, Denmark&amp;hellip; you name it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2016/06/Randa-meetings-work-discussions.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;KDE Randa meetings: developers discussions&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those people are so different&amp;hellip; and yet they all work together to hopefully make the computer world a slightly better place. There was such a strong ambience there that we all worked very hard. I was up around 7:00 every morning, and went off to bed at 23:00. I spent the vast majority of the day working. And it was pretty much the same for everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The village we stayed at itself was peaceful and lovely. A perfect, undistracted place to both focus and relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2016/06/Randa-view-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Randa view of the mountains&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The view was gorgeous from my office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;time-to-make-some-money-again&#34;&gt;Time to make some money again&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I told you in a previous update, Game Art Quest became bigger than what it was supposed to be. With the Kickstarter, we raised enough money for six months of full-time work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These six months are getting to an end, so I have to make a bit of money again. I&amp;rsquo;m getting new offers on a weekly basis, but until now, I almost declined them all. However, I accepted one job writing Krita tutorials for a magazine this month. It is a great opportunity as they asked me to work on animation, which I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered yet in the training, thus it&amp;rsquo;s not distracting me from daily work too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking to start working on and selling the next 2 volumes of the training in early access at the end of July. If I sell enough, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to keep working full-time on it. Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;ll dedicate one day per week to client work, which shouldn&amp;rsquo;t slow down the production of the training noticeably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;this-week&#34;&gt;This week&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap up June, I have to release a brush pack update. This new version will contain 4 new brushes, and I painted a new thumbnail for the blender brush, as the current one looks horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2016/06/Flat-blender-brush.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;New flat blender brush icon&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;rsquo;m working on the fourth chapter in the Krita training, to release it as soon as possible. It will introduce you to the game assets creation workflow. As soon as it is out, I will move on to the second volume of the training, which you will be able to access on Gumroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving into July, I have to get working again on the blender of VSE add-on. It is one of the main ways I can improve my productivity creating the video tutorials now. My goal is to add one new feature every single week, even if it&amp;rsquo;s small. This week for instance, I&amp;rsquo;m working on an import feature that loads all of the project&amp;rsquo;s video and audio files to the VSE in one click. As I get to create up to six videos in a single week, this feature will be a real time saver. And with that, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to release the first public version of the add-on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/img/post/2016/06/blender-vse-add-on-code.png&#34; alt=&#34;Blender GDquest VSE add-on import code&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The import code is already there - it just needs to be refined&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get back to work! Thank you all for reading. Thank you for constant support and your kind words. I read all of your comments on Youtube, on social networks, and the messages you send me via email. It&amp;rsquo;s really heartwarming to see some of you following everything that&amp;rsquo;s happening on a weekly basis. Big thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until now, the tutorials have been a bit random on GDquest. I jumped from theme to theme based on your requests or ideas I had. But now, we&amp;rsquo;re in 2016. I want us to try something new. &lt;strong&gt;It is time for you, members of the community, to choose the tutorial series you want to see on the channel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose a handful of ideas based on your feedback and on what I can handle right now. There are 2 themes that I didn’t list, on purpose: animation and the Godot engine. Here&amp;rsquo;s why: there will be some animation tutorials when Krita 3.0 is released. And I am waiting for Godot 2.0 to cover it on the channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-your-voice-be-heard&#34;&gt;Let your voice be heard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can pick as many series as you’d like! I will produce the 3 most popular entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can find more information about each and every series below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/Tutorials/Banners/Small/superpowers-html5.png&#34; alt=&#34;Superpowers, the collaborative HTML5 game engine tutorial banner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview-of-superpowers-the-collaborative-html5-game-engine&#34;&gt;Overview of Superpowers, the collaborative HTML5 game engine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superpowers is a fully functional 2-D and 3-D HTML5 game editor that was released a few days ago, free and open source. It is based on three.JS and it uses Typescript, a superset of JavaScript. Not only that, it allows you to collaborate on projects online in real time! Although it is still young, the toolset is already impressive. In the development team is already at work on exciting new features!
By the way, it’s not their first shot at game engines. The project is made by &lt;a href=&#34;https://sparklinlabs.com/&#34;&gt;Sparkin Labs&lt;/a&gt;, the authors of &lt;a href=&#34;http://craftstud.io/&#34;&gt;CraftStudio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/Tutorials/Banners/Small/godot-2d-engine.png&#34; alt=&#34;Human proportions, from reality to games tutorial banner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview-of-godot-2-0-the-open-source-game-engine-for-2d-games&#34;&gt;Overview of Godot 2.0, the open source game engine, for 2d games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.godotengine.org/projects/godot-engine&#34;&gt;Godot&lt;/a&gt; is an open source 2d and 3d game engine. It was developed in-house by an Argentinian game studio, Okam, and released open source 2 years ago. Godot 2.0 features a robust editor with built-in animation tools, a visual shader editor, and much more!
In this series, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the basics of 2d game development with Godot. If you want to join the community, check out its &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/godotengine/&#34;&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/Tutorials/Banners/Small/human-proportions-from-reality-to-games.png&#34; alt=&#34;Human proportions, from reality to games tutorial banner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;human-proportions-from-reality-to-games&#34;&gt;Human proportions, from reality to games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of tutorials available on the basics of human anatomy and proportions (I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/ProkoTV&#34;&gt;Proko&amp;rsquo;s videos&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here though, I want to create a series unlike most of what you&amp;rsquo;ll find online. We will take a look at the general proportions of human beings. We will look at both male and female. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover some critical landmarks of the human body. We will then compare it with the proportions of children, and teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, we will then discuss how we can play with those proportions in games. We&amp;rsquo;ll look at what rules designers break, and which ones they respect. We will look at various examples of stylized characters in popular games, and we will then work on our own character thumbnails. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big topic, perfect to complement Game Art Quest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/Tutorials/Banners/Small/blender-vse.png&#34; alt=&#34;Blender VSE tutorial banner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-to-video-editing-with-blender&#34;&gt;Introduction to video editing with Blender&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blender is an impressive piece of software. It is also my open source replacement for After Effects and a video editing tool of choice. Its sequencer has its shortcomings, but it is an efficient tool to get started making videos nonetheless. In this series, I will share what I have learned creating YouTube videos with blender for the past 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/Tutorials/Banners/Small/becoming-a-game-designer.png&#34; alt=&#34;Becoming a game designer tutorial banner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;becoming-an-independent-game-designer&#34;&gt;Becoming an independent game designer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a game designer? How can you become a professional or an independent game designer? Based on my experience creating games with a talented engineer, working as a freelancer and now creating Game Design Quest, I will share what I learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you which college you should pick, but I can help you to teach yourself game design. That is what this series is all about. &lt;strong&gt;It is not a series about creating a business and selling your games!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/Tutorials/Banners/Small/introduction-music-scoring-for-games.png&#34; alt=&#34;Introduction to music scoring for games tutorial banner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-primer-on-music-scoring-for-games&#34;&gt;A primer on music scoring for games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, but I write and produce &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/gdquest&#34;&gt;game soundtracks&lt;/a&gt;! I actually studied music scoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing good music takes a lot of experience! And the resources for it are sometimes overly complicated, or plain mystical. I was lucky to learn music with a teacher who’s all about analysis and clarity. I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some of what he taught me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;166&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/243108339&amp;amp;color=ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This isn’t a series about music production using a DAW&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Digital Audio Workstation&lt;/em&gt;) like FL studio. Music scoring is a huge topic. This is but an introduction to music as a language! I will try to give you a good sense of what the building blocks of a score are, and what scoring for games is like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/Tutorials/Banners/Small/rock-and-grass-tiles.png&#34; alt=&#34;Rock tiles tutorial banner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;painting-rock-and-grass-tiles-for-2d-games&#34;&gt;Painting rock and grass tiles for 2d games&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one type of 2-D game asset that is rarely explained online: tiles. These are sprites that connect seamlessly to one another and that you can reuse extensively to create your game backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial series, I will show you how to create tiles for the ground and for walls or hanging ceiling in an outdoor environment, in a side scrolling game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gdquest.com/Tutorials/Banners/Small/kickstarter-tips.png&#34; alt=&#34;Game Art Quest Kickstarter tutorial banner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;kickstarter-all-of-my-hard-learned-tips&#34;&gt;Kickstarter: all of my hard learned tips!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know I ran a Kickstarter campaign that was successfully funded. Better than that, it doubled the initial goal! During those hectic weeks, struggling to keep up with the frightening workload, I learned a lot about crowdfunding. With this theme, I want to go over the preparation, the ongoing production and the communication you have to take care of during the course of a Kickstarter campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
