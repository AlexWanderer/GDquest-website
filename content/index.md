      I'm Nathan, a professional game designer.
      I'm the author of <a href="http://youtube.com/c/gdquest">GDquest</a>, a Youtube channel filled with tutorials about game art and game design.
      And I'm building a community around <strong>game creation</strong> and <strong>open source software</strong>.

      The website will be a hub for the community and open source assets.
