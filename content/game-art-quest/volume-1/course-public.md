Welcome to Game Art Quest volume 1. This is a complete free training dedicated to Krita. Over the course of 6 chapters, and multiple hours of content, it will run you through Krita's most useful tools for 2-D game artists.

If you're an illustrator or a concept artist, don't leave just yet! There is a lot for you to learn in here as well.

This course was made possible thanks to the pledges of 424 backers.
