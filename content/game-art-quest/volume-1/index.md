## Chapter 1: Overview of Krita

The idea behind this first chapter is to make you comfortable with the application in as little time as possible. It focuses only on the most important tools you'll need to produce your art.

1. **Quickstart Guide Chapter Introduction**
2. **Getting to know the UI**: Understanding the various parts of the interface, the philosophy behind Krita's design, the dockers.
3. **Navigation on the canvas**
4. **Painting with the freehand brush tool**: brushes can do a lot of things in Krita, so I'll try to give you a quick sense of how they work. We'll see how Krita can turn every single brush into an eraser. We'll also learn how to use the alpha lock painting mode
5. **Picking colors and using the pop-up palette**: this shortcut wheel allows you to quickly switch between the background and foreground colors, to pick colors, to access a history of the last used colors and brush presets.
6. **An introduction to layers**: the layer docker is being changed a lot in Krita 3, so we'll just look at the basics here. We'll learn to create layers, groups, to rename them, to toggle visibility, and also we'll see how we can pick a layer from the canvas.
7. **Working with selections**: we'll focus on the most common operations with the outline, contiguous, square and elliptical selection tools.
8. **Filling outlines and selections**
9. **Move tool and free transform**
10. **Setting your own shortcuts**

## Chapter 2: the 2d game asset worklow

This second chapter provides an introduction to the game art workflow with Krita. It explains the iterative nature of game art, as well as the broad steps involved in creating original game assets, from design to the finished product. I will also provide you with an example to show you which tools I use the most, and how I've adapted my workflow to Krita.

1. **2d Game art vs Illustration: what's the difference?**
2. **Overview of the game asset painting workflow**
3. **The game asset workflow: sketching thumbnails**
4. **Sketching tricks with Krita**
5. **Blocking a game sprite**
6. **Refining or bringing out the spirit of an asset**
7. **Techniques to refine a painting with Krita**

## Chapter 3: diving deeper

The application offers a wealth of unexpected features. Powerful deformations, wrap-around mode, flexible brush engines, drawing assistants, filter layers, and much more! In this chapter, we'll look at some of the more advanced functions Krita offers, as well as how to use them in practice.

We'll specifically look at the tools that will not change in Krita 3.0.
