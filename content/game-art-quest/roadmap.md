<h2 id="roadmap">{{< icon gears default >}}Roadmap <small>I'm working on...</small></h2>

The plan is to start with the free Krita to training series 1st as it is a prerequisite for the other 2 volumes. Then, I will move on to volume 2 to provide the Kickstarter backers with premium content.

### Global progress

**Volume 1**

_The first videos are done and I finished all of my freelance contracts. I'm now working full time on the project, working on exercises, videos, and trying to help the community the best I can._

### Volume 1 - Krita

_Pre-production is essential to ensure that the course will deliver its promises. In this case, the goal is to focus on game art and improving your workflow._

- **Chapter 0 - All you need to get started**

This first chapter will run you through Krita's core tools. In about 30 minutes, it will show you everything you need to know to start working on your own art!
